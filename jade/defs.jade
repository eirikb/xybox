      XYBox is built on definitions called _defs_.
      It is a way to describe an item, such as a car, player, house, ball or brick wall.  
      The def define item _physics_, _graphics_ and _behavior_.
      Physics and graphics are defined in _JSON_ files, 
      while the behavior and logic is defined in _JS_ files.
    h3 Ball
    :markdown
      As an example we will try to make a ball with a _defs_ file.  
      First we need an image, like this one:  
      ![chrome logo](img/chrome.png)  
      _[(img/chrome.png)](img/chrome.png)_.  
      Then we can define this in a _defs_ file like this (_ball1.json_):
    .row
      .span6
        h5 Input
        pre.prettyprint
          include ../defs/ball1.json
      .span6
        h5 Output
        canvas#ball1

    :markdown
      Here _items_ indicate the items we want to draw.
      The _images_ in _graphics_ will be preloaded (only once pr src).

    p Run like this with JavaScript:
    pre.prettyprint game.init('ball1', 'defs/ball1.json');
    :markdown
      First argument, _ball1_, is _ID_ of canvas, and second argument is definition (_defs_) file.
