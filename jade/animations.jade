      Animations in XYBox are defined inside the _JSON_ files.  
      All animations must be in form of sprites,
      for example with the Chrome logo "ball" from earlier:  
      ![Chrome logo](img/chrome-anim.png)  
      _[(img/chrome-anim.png)](img/chrome-anim.png)_.  

      This might seem a bit wasteful, since the image could simply be rotated by the canvas.  
      Although having one single solution for animations makes it much more consistent
      and easy to work with.  
      The overall size and performance will not be 
      that much affected. In the case of the ball it will be, but in a whole games
      most animations are more complex.

      The animations are defined in _defs_ like this:

    .row
      .span6
        h5 Input
        a(href='defs/ball-anim.json') ball-anim.json
        pre.prettyprint
          include ../defs/ball-anim.json
      .span6
        h5 Output
        canvas.ball#ball-anim

      Note that "_default_" will be run automatically. Simply call it something 
      different to prevent it from executing.

      Look at [EaselJS SpriteSheet documentation](http://www.createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/SpriteSheet.html) to see different methods to do animations.  

    .row
      .span6
        h5 Input
        a(href='defs/ball-anims.json') ball-anims.json
        pre.prettyprint
          include ../defs/ball-anims.json
      .span6
        h5 Output
        canvas.ball#ball-anims
