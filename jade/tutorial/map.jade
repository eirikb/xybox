      For the map we only need a couple of components, bricks and blocks.
      We could also need some stairs, to reach next level.
      The bricks are destroyable with bombs, while the blocks are not.  
      Also, bricks can be destroyed, and so they need some animation:  
      ![Map items](defs/tutorial/map.png)  
      (_block, brick with animation and some stairs_)
