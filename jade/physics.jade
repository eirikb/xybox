      XYBox let you combine physics and graphics in the same _JSON_ file.  
      Lets add some physics to our ball:

    .row
      .span6
        h5 Input
        a(href='defs/ball-physics.json') ball-physics.json
        pre.prettyprint
          include ../defs/ball-physics.json
      .span6
        h5 Output
        canvas.ball#ball-physics

      That does not seem very fantastic, but that is a full blown physical object, trust me,
      it can do marvelous things.

      Lets add this brick wall: ![Brick wall](img/brick-wall.png) and some behavior with JS:

    .row
      .span6
        h5 Input
        a(href='defs/ball-physics-code.json') ball-physics-code.json
        pre.prettyprint
          include ../defs/ball-physics-code.json
        a(href='defs/ball-physics-code.js') ball-physics-code.js
        pre.prettyprint= read('defs/ball-physics-code.js')
      .span6
        h5 Output
        canvas.ball#ball-physics-code(height=300)
