# HTML5-Game-Bootstrap

This is not a library, instead it is a set of existing libraries
put together to create a bootstrap for creating web-based games.

Main technologies are canvas for graphics,
Box2D for physics, JSON with preloading for architecture, 
and a simple event-system for modularity.
JavaScript is used for logic, but these files are also preloaded.

## Libraries

*  [EaselJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS) - Graphics and animations (canvas).
*  [PreloadJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/PreloadJS) - Preloading JSON and JavaScript files.
*  [Box2d.js](https://github.com/HBehrens/box2d.js) - JavaScript port of Box2D.
*  [Trolley](https://github.com/eirikb/trolley) - Utility library for Box2d.js, also used to build box bodies from JSON.
*  [Kibo](https://github.com/marquete/kibo) - Keyboard input.
